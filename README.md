Welcome to our React-based quiz project! This project is designed to allow users to test their knowledge on a variety of subjects in a fun and engaging way.

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
2.Run npm install to install all the required dependencies.<br>
3.Run npm start to start the development server and launch the app in your browser.<br>
4.Once the app is running, you will be presented with a list of quizzes to choose from. Simply click on the quiz you want to take and begin answering the questions. You will be given feedback on each question, and at the end of the quiz you will see your final score.<br>

5.The app is built using React and utilizes several other libraries, including Redux for state management and Axios for making API calls. The quiz questions and answers are stored in a JSON file, which can be easily edited or replaced to create new quizzes.<br>

6.We hope you enjoy using this project as much as we enjoyed building it. 
<br>Happy quizzing!
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
